# shame
Civitas Hackathon 2015 entry. Class attendance reinforcement tool, for Android phones.

Shame is a tool for assisting students in attending their college classes, by emphasizing the financial impact of their non-attendance.

Students input their tuition and course schedules. Then, at the beginning of each of their lectures, they receive and interactive notification asking if they made it to class. If they did not, Shame adds the monetary value of that class to a running total it keeps.

This entry placed third at the Civitas 2015 Hackathon.
